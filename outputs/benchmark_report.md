# NLP Methods Benchmark Report

## Speed Performance
- TF-IDF: 0.0097 seconds
- Transformer: 0.0506 seconds
- Speed Ratio: 5.24x slower for Transformers

## Accuracy Performance (Mean Absolute Error)
- TF-IDF MAE: 0.4709
- Transformer MAE: 0.1367
- Accuracy Improvement: 71.0%

## Key Findings
- Transformers are more accurate but slower than TF-IDF
- Transformers better capture semantic similarity
- TF-IDF is suitable for large-scale, real-time applications
- Transformers excel in tasks requiring deep semantic understanding

## Recommendations
- Use TF-IDF for: Large datasets, real-time systems, keyword-based similarity
- Use Transformers for: Semantic search, content recommendation, high-accuracy requirements
