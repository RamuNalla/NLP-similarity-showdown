# NLP Similarity Showdown

A comparison of text similarity methods from the classical TF-IDF to modern transformer-based embeddings. 

This project demonstrates how different NLP techniques capture semantic relationships and provides detailed analysis and their performance characteristics.

## Project Overview

This project compares three main approaches to text similarity:
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Classical statistical method
- **Transformers**: Modern DL approach using pre-trained sentence embeddings

The analysis reveals how transformers capture semantic similarity more accurately than traditional methods, especially for sentences with similar meanings but different vocabulary.
